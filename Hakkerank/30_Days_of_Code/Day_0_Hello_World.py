# Hackerrank 30 days of code
# Day 0: Hello World

# Task 
# To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print "Hello, World."" on a single line, 
# and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

# Input Format
# A single line of text denoting input_string (the variable whose contents must be printed).

# Output Format
# Print Hello, World. on the first line, and the contents of input_string on the second line.

# ====== Write your code here =====

# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
input_string = input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print('Hello, World.')

# Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
print(input_string)
